		<p>I was referred by a current client to redesign the wedding venue website for Villa Franca Estate. This beautiful property blends rustic elements with southern charm. The old website did not reflect the elegant nature of their brand. We collaborated to design a new website to capture the attention of users and align to their business model.<p>

		<h2 class="case-headings">Identifying the Problems</h3>

		<p>While the old site was reasonably easy to navigate and maintain, the main problem was that it was outdated and not distinctive to the Villa Franca brand. As market saturation in the wedding venue of Charlotte rises, we had to ask ourselves “is it memorable?” when looking at competitor websites. The old web experience was not memorable or distinctive to their brand.</p>

		
		<h2 class="case-headings">Solution</h3>
		
		<p>The client wanted to keep all their current copy and information. The most important criteria when choosing a wedding venue are pictures, testimonials, location, and price. The redesign centered around emphasising these features but updating with a more modern look and feel. We wanted the site to still be informational but also reflect the rustic elegance the brand was working to establish.</p>


		<h2 class="case-headings">What I learned</h3>

		<p>Design problems come in many different forms. There is no “one-size” fits all solution. It’s not always appropriate to emulate the newest or most popular design patterns of the day. You have to truly listen to the client and find a solution that is not only visually appealing, but also meets the needs of  their individual brand.</p>
